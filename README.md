Included is a dataset of machine counted minnesota congressional district 8 with precicnts of 50-400 RV. RV was calculated by summing EDR and 7AM column. However this may not be the best method, but I wanted to match what ETA did with their analysis. The code includes the packages loaded, the regression, and the partial regresison plots.

Data for 2024 and 2020 elections was gathered from the State of Minnesota's website

Included is a dataset of machine counted minnesota congressional district 8 with precicnts of 50-400 RV. RV was calculated by summing EDR and 7AM column. However this may not be the best method, but I wanted to match what ETA did with their analysis. The code includes the packages loaded, the regression, and the partial regresison plots
